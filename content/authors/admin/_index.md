Hi! I am a PhD student currently pursuing my studies in the Tri-Institutional PhD Program in Computational Biology and Medicine, a collaborative effort between Cornell University, Weill Cornell Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and Rockefeller University. I graduated with a Master of Science degree in Computer Science at University of Toronto, focusing on AI for health research. I had the privilege of being mentored by [Dr. Anna Goldenberg](https://vectorinstitute.ai/team/anna-goldenberg/), who is affiliated with both SickKids Hospital and Vector Institute. Before my time at the UofT, I studied Biomedical Engineering at the University of Waterloo. There, I specialized in AI and computing, which helped build a solid foundation for my current research. 

My research work primarily focuses on computational biology, digital health, wearable technology, medical imaging, and more! As an AI4Medicine researcher, I would like to bridge the gap between AI and medicine and make an impact in the healthcare field.
