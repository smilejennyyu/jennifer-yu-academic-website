Hi! I'm an MSc student at the University of Toronto (UofT), studying Computer Science with a research focus on AI for health.  I'm privileged to be mentored by [Dr. Anna Goldenberg](https://vectorinstitute.ai/team/anna-goldenberg/), who is affiliated with both SickKids Hospital and Vector Institute. Before my time at the UofT, I studied Biomedical Engineering at the University of Waterloo. There, I specialized in AI and computing, which helped build a solid foundation for my current research. 

My research work primarily focuses on digital health, wearable tech, time series, medical imaging, and causality. Currently, my main project aims to leverage the power of AI-based methods to gain profound insights into pregnancy-related physiology. This includes comprehending mental health symptoms, identifying complications, and assessing delivery readiness.  As a Machine Learning researcher in the healthcare field, I am deeply committed to bridging the gap between AI and healthcare, aiming to make a meaningful impact on the healthcare field!
