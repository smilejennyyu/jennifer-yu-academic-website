title: "Time for Baby: Leveraging Wearable Data to Enhance Personalized Pregnancy Outcomes - Delivery Readiness"
summary: This research project aims to use data from wearable devices to assess delivery readiness during pregnancy on an individual basis. The study collects physiological data from pregnant women to identify specific maternal indicators that could predict delivery readiness and potentially reduce the risk of adverse outcomes for both mothers and infants.

This research project aims to investigate the potential of using multivariate time series data from wearable devices to assess delivery readiness during pregnancy on an individual basis. The study collects data from a group of 18+ pregnant women using wearable and mobile devices that capture physiological signals, such as heart rate, heart rate variability and respiration rate. The goal is to identify specific maternal indicators in the data that could be indicative of delivery readiness. The results of this study could have significant implications for predicting delivery readiness, enabling unknown medical discoveries, and potentially reducing the risk of adverse outcomes for both mothers and infants.
