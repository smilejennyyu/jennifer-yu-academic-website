abstract: Maternal health is one of the main sustainable development goals of the World Health Organization (WHO). Changes associated with pregnancy can be reflected in the physiological, psychological and behavioral states of women. In this study, we investigated relationships between Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and mental health symptoms such as depression and anxiety over pregnancy and into the postpartum period, as well as  quality of life. Further, we examined the interrelationship between mental health and physical health during  and post pregnancy, finding that the effects during pre and postnatal periods tend to differ. We hope that our analysis lays potential groundwork for exploring more complex relationships between mental health symptoms and ACEs during and post pregnancy.


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We used causal discovery framework to perform analyses and drew meaningful insights on the relationships between mental health symptoms and ACEs during and post pregnancy.
